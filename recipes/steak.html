        <h3>Steak Using the Fast-Flip Method</h3>

        <p>When you are using the fast-flip method of cooking steak, you flip the steak every 30 seconds, which gives
            great
            results every time. And the steak cooks 30% faster, to boot!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul style="padding-left: 25px;">
            <li>1 beef sirloin steak, at room temperature</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons high-heat cooking oil, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol style="padding-left: 25px;">
            <li>Preheat a heavy cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Pat steak dry with paper towels on both sides.
                Season generously with salt on both sides.</li>
            <li>Drizzle oil into the hot skillet. Add steak and cook for 30 seconds. Flip steak onto the other side and
                cook for 30 seconds, then flip again. Continue flipping, cooking 30 seconds on each side.</li>
            <li>Remove steak from the pan when it has developed a brown crust, is beginning to firm, and is hot and
                slightly pink in the center, about 3 to 4 minutes of total cooking time for a 1-inch steak. Check for
                doneness using an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center and these numbers as a guideline:
                125 degrees F (52 degrees C) for rare; 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium rare; 145 degrees F (65
                degrees C) for medium; or 160 degrees F (70 degrees C) for well done.</li>
            <li>Cover steak with 2 layers of aluminum foil and allow to rest in a warm area for 5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
